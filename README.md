# cynamic
 A programming language implimentation built on python to enforce C-style syntax.
 

 Syntax: All blocks of code are contained in C-style curly braces ({}). Variables are delcared just like in python or javascript, no strong typing. Every line is defined by a semi-colon just like C or java. Declaring function are defined as 'function FUNCTION_NAME' followed by parameters. Every program must have a 'main' function in order to run. To import other code into your program, use the preprocessr function '#include' followed by the .pyc file you wish to import or '<PYTHON_IMPORT>' and it will import your files accordingly.
